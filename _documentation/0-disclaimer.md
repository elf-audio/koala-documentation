1. We try to make sure this manual is as up to date and accurate as possible, but sometimes it falls behind as we devote most of our time to working on new features and fixing bugs.

2. Not all features are available on all platforms, this manual tries to make clear where this is the case. If you need to know with absolute certainty whether a feature is available please read the app store/play store description of the app, PLEASE don't go off this manual. Thank you to Anthony Harbort for pointing this out.

3. If you see a problem here, please feel free to get in touch at <https://www.koalasampler.com/contact> to let me know to fix it. This manual is open source, so if you want to take more direct action pls feel free to make a pull request here: <https://www.github.com/elf-audio/koala-documentation>
