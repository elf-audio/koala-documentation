Image: grid mode with scale selection

GRID mode shows notes locked to one of the available scales: 
CHROMATIC: all 12 notes per octave are available
PENTATONIC: 5 notes per octave
MAJOR: 7 notes of the major scale per octave
MINOR: 7 notes of the minor scale per octave
WHOLE TONE: 6 notes per octave
DIMINISHED: 8 notes per octave
HEXATONIC: 6 notes per octave
JAPANESE: 5 notes per octave
PELOG: 5 notes per octave
YING ZHONG: 5 notes per octave

Use the selector at left side / bottom left side to change scales.

Note: tap several areas to play chords of up to 5 voices.

Pro tip: resample a chord to a pad, then use that pad in grid mode again to play chords that are always in scale.
