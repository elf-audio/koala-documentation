## 5.3. Tempo Menu

Tap the metronome button to enable or disable metronome sound.

Double tap on tempo to open TEMPO MENU.

* TEMPO: tap and drag within the tempo to gradually change the tempo. Fine dragging changes tempo in decimal increments. Fast dragging changes tempo in full increments.
* -, TAP, +: change tempo by 1 bpm with the -/+, tap the TAP button repeatedly to set tempo
* BEATS PER BAR: change the number of beats per bar. Use this setting to change the time signature of your song
* QUANTIZE: enable or disable note quantization. When disabled, recorded notes are placed exactly as placed. Enabling quantization records notes to the nearest 1/16th of the note.
* SEQ SNAP: when changing sequences from one to another (e.g, in the UI or via MIDI), controls how quickly the sequence will switch from the current playing sequence to the newly selected sequence. When disabled, the end of the note is recorded as played and then the sequence is immediately switched to the selected next sequence. 1 BEAT, 1 BAR and SEQ END waits until the end of the respective time step (the end of the currently playing beat, bar or sequence) before switching to the newly selected sequence. Note that when you use a sequence snap setting other than the OFF setting, the next sequence ALWAYS starts at the beginning of the newly selected sequence - with snap off, it always matches the current position of the playhead, so the sequence can jump mid sequence to another.
* SWING: increase or decrease amount of swing for note playback by draggin within the SWING bar.
