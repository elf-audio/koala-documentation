Image: grid controls: pen, vel, random

PEN: enables adding and removing notes in the grid view
VEL: enables changing the velocity of the notes. Tap and slide up/down on notes to change its velocity. This also works with selections.
DICE: enables randomization of the notes. Tap and slide up/down on notes to change their chance of being played. This also works with selections.

Pro tip: randomization is a great way to create ever changing sequences. Try this on your drums or melodic notes.
