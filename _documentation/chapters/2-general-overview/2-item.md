Sequence

Set tempo, time signature and quantization of your track. Record and merge up to 16 sequences of virtually any length. Tap the record button to start recording a sequence. Tap play button to play back selected sequence. 

Drag sequences over the sequencer slots to copy, merge or replace them. 

Use one of the 3 trigger modes to play your samples chromatically: scale grid, piano keys and note repeat.
