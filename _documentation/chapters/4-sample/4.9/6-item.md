Image: chop controls

KEEP ORIGINAL: turn on if you want to keep the original sample. It will be replaced by the first chop when off.

CHOKE GROUP: adds all chops to the selected choke group

ONESHOT: set all chops to ONESHOT mode

PLAYTHRU: set the endpoint for all chops to the end of the sample. When off, chops start at their marker and stop at the next marker.

Pro tip: change the volume, pitch, panning, tone, stretch and reverse settings of your sample as needed before entering AUTO-CHOP. Chopping is applied to a resampled version with those settings baked in.
