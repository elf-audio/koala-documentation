Image: swapping pads

Tap and drag a pad with a sample over a free pad to copy it. If the target pad is not empty, you will be prompted to either

merge samples of both pads
swap samples of both pads
add the pad youâ€™re dragging to the end of the original pad

Merging mixes both samples, replacing the sample on the target pad. Adding to the end replaces the target pad with extended version of the sample.

Note : All parameters you set on both samples are kept when merging and extending them.
