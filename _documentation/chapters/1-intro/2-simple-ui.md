Thanks to Koalaâ€™s simple interface, you'll be building tracks in a flash. Resampling is available for external sources, like audio interfaces, built-in mic or other apps, as well as from Koala itself.

When resampling from Koala, a whole sequence can be bounced in one tap, with or without applying Koala's live FX.
