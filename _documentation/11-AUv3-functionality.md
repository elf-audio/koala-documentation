title: AUv3 Functionality
order: 11
---

(Please note that this feature is for iOS only - AUv3 is an Apple technology, Google cannot incorporate this into the Android OS and there is no Android equivalent as of writing this on 19/02/2025)

Koala can be loaded as AUv3 plugin in host applications like AUM, Garageband, Logic Pro and Cubasis.

Koala cannot send transport information to the AUv3 host, meaning you need to enable playback in your host application for the sequencer in Koala to start/stop playback.

Koala can be loaded in three different modes apps:

- as AUv3 instrument
- as AUv3 effect
- as a multi-bus AUv3 plugin.

Note: Stem Split and Solo/Mute features of Koala are not available in AUv3 mode.
