Koala is automatically available as AUv3 plugin for use in your AUv3 host applications like AUM, Garageband, Logic Pro, Cubase and so on.

Koala cannot send transport information to the AUv3 host, meaning you need to enable playback in your host application for the sequencer in Koala to start/stop playback.

There are three different modes Koala can be loaded in another apps: as AUv3 instrument, as AUv3 effect and as a multi-bus AUv3 plugin. All functionality stays the same, except for a few exceptions outlined below.

Additional 8 output sources are available when Koala is loaded as AUv3 plugin. 

Note: only AUv3 hosts supporting multi-bus functionality make additional output destinations available. Currently, only AUM supports multi-bus format.
